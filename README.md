# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview
Our client, Rosa, has partnered with the company Improbable beef to conduct research that is looking for a strain of microbacteria that can best mirror the taste of beef. Rosa's goal is to visualize her findings in the form of a dashboard and to make said dashbaord intreactive for both her fellow researchers, as well as the subjects in her study. The subjects in the study would be able to access the data via a webpage, search the data based on their ID, and see which bacteria live in their navals, which is where Rosa hypothesizes the microbacteria she is searching for resides.

## Results

## Summary
The test subjects in Rosa's study can select their subject ID from the dropdown menu labeled "Test Subject ID No.". Once they do so, various charts specific to their samples will populate, and those charts will give information to the test subjects such as the top 10 bacteria's found in their naval, how many stains of bacteria were found in the sample they provided, and how many times a week they wash their naval. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
