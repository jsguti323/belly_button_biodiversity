# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview
Our client, Rosa, has partnered with the company Improbable beef to conduct research that is looking for a strain of microbacteria that can best mirror the taste of beef. Rosa's goal is to visualize her findings in the form of a dashboard and to make said dashbaord intreactive for both her fellow researchers, as well as the subjects in her study. The subjects in the study would be able to access the data via a webpage, search the data based on their ID, and see which bacteria live in their navals, which is where Rosa hypothesizes the microbacteria she is searching for resides.
